# OCRTool
This is a personal project that implements an OCR tool on a web page.
Credit for the implementation of OCR using Python, Flask, and HTML goes to this source:

- although some of my code is different, the website I used deserves credit for help with my solution

Instructions to view the web page and use the tool:
1. Both python files need to be in the same folder
2. The HTML files need to be put in a folder called "templates"
3. The CSS files need to be in a folder called "css" and put inside a folder called "static"
4. Run the ocr_flask.py file, then copy and paste the link to a web browser
5. Choose an image with text to upload and click "Ready" to start using the tool

Note: the OCR tool is not 100% accurate
